## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Group04_DecisionTree_Project.git
     ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
     ```bash
     cd 02_Experiments/source_code
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     pip install --upgrade pip
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
3. **Run 3 file notebooks to get the results:**
     ```bash
